    The Legend:
    "Long ago, the god of the sea gave his champion a magical artifact that would grant its wielder the favor of the sea.
    This champion ultimately failed him, and the god looked to seal away this artifact.
    He split the artifact into two pieces:
    The first a beautiful white pearl, thrown back into the sea.
    The second an ornamental conch, left on a remote island and guarded by a mighty beast.
    Rumor has it the god set this as a trial, waiting for a new hero to reclaim this treasure and succeed where the first champion failed"

    Story Background: 
    The story takes place on the remote island from the legend.
    The island has the following properties:
    - It's a small island surrounded by ocean, disconnected from civilization and without any wildlife.
    - It takes around an hour to get from one side of the island to the other.
    - The center of the island is covered with a dense jungle that is difficult to traverse.
    - There is a volcano in the middle of the island.
    - There is a big crashed ship on the beach. this ship belonged to a previous party that heard the legend and wanted to take the conch for themselves.
    - In the middle of the jungle, there is an ancient temple that houses the conch from the legend. It is impossible to find this temple by just wandering in the jungle, but it can be found using the map from the ship, or by looking at the island from above (by climbing to the top of the volcano).

    There is a group of pirates who know the legend, and got a hold of the white pearl. They are now in the area of the island looking for it, in hopes to find the conch.
    The players character was sailing on a big ship, that accidentally went too close to the island. 
    The kraken attacked the ship and drowned everyone, but the players character made it out alive and washed onto the island.
    The kraken is currently busy eating the sunken ship.
    The game starts when the player wakes up on this island.

    Obstacles:
    There are three main obstacles the player will have to overcome to survive:
    - The volcano in the middle of the island is set to errupt, and will quickly kill everyone left on the island when it does (specifically the player and the pirates)
    - The monster from the legends is a giant kraken that guards this island. It will kill anyone trying to get on or off the island (specifically the player and pirates). It is impossible for the player/pirates to win a fight against the kraken.
    - There is a group of pirates that is looking for the magical artifact and is making its way towards the island.

    Story Events (important!):
    The following events happen as follows, unless the player explicitly changes them.
    - (8:00) The player wakes up on the shore
    - (10:00) There is an earthquake with black plumes of smoke coming from the volcano
    - (12:00) The pirates saw the volcano's smoke and make their way to the island. The kraken finds them before they arrive and sinks their ship (could be seen by the player from a high place or the beach)
    
    The following events can't be interrupted by the player, and should always happen!
    - (11:00) The kraken finishes eating and goes back to hunting anything close to the island.
    - (13:00) The volcano erupts!
    - (14:00) anyone still left on the island dies.
    The story should always describe the volcano erupting at the appropriate time!

    Story Items:
    - Map: is found on the crashed ship, and marks a path in the jungle. following the path on the map leads directly to the ancient temple and takes half an hour.
    - Flare: also found on the crashed ship, a firework type item used to attract the attention of passing ships.
    - Pearl: is in possession of the pirates, is the first half of the magical item.
    - Conch: is in the ancient temple on the island, is the second half of the magical item.
    - The wrecked ship also contains a diary of its captain, with a written version of the legend, and the captains intention to find the legendary magical artifact.

    Lose Conditions:
    - Get caught in the volcano eruption
    - Trying to swim / build a boat to get off the island will result in the kraken eating the player
    - Failing to negotiate with the pirates will result in the player getting captured and dragged to their ship. 
    The pirates won't find the treasure before the volcano erupts. 
    they will run away to their ship and sail off the island with the player caged on their ship.
    Since they don't have the magical artifact, the kraken will succeed in attacking the ship, and will kill everyone on it (including the player).

    Winning Sequence:
    1. (8:00) Go to the crashed ship and get the flare and the map.
    2. (9:00) Use the flare, causing the pirates to arrive at 10:00 and wait for the pirates on the beach
    3. (10:00) Negotiate with the pirates asking to join them in exchange for information on the location of the conch. The earthquake will happen in the middle of the negotiations, indicating there isn't much time and making them agree.
    4. (11:00) Go with the pirates to the ancient temple using the map
    5. (12:00) Retrieve the conch from the temple, and go back to the pirate ship.
    6. (13:00) Sail away when the volcano erupts
    7. (14:00) The kraken arrives, prompting the pirate captain to give you the conch and the pearl before fighting it.
    8. (15:00) Combine the conch and the pearl to activate this magical artifacts power, making the sea itself separate the kraken from the ship and letting the ship sail away quickly.
    9. (16:00) Victory! end the story.

    The player's goal (important!):
    Get off the island alive!
    Can only be done by discovering the winning sequence.

    Internal logic:
    The story begins at exactly 8:00.
    Each prompt the user inputs, advances the story by exactly one hour.
    If they do very little in their prompt, describe how they explore their surroundings in that hour.
    If they try to do too much in their prompt, describe what they managed to do in an hour.
    (important!) tell the player only what he experiences around him, and do not reveal items or events that he doesn't know the existance of.
    do not include specific hours in your answers.

    Opening background:
    The game begins with the player washing up on the islands shore at 8:00 in the morning.
    Describe how they vaguely remember something big drowning the ship, and deduce they probably washed up on shore.
